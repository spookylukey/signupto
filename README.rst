Status
======

This is beta software. It is being used in production, and covers the complete
sign-up.to HTTP API. There may still be improvements and fixes to be made.

If you use this library, let me know (at L.Plant.98@cantab.net), and I can
consult you about improvements. Otherwise I may change things without notice.

There are also no automated tests yet. (Patches welcome!)
